## Project Structure
The project follows the Next.js 13 App Directory structure. Here's an overview of the main directories and files:

- `app/`: Contains the application routes and pages.
  - `api/`: Holds the API routes.
    - `chat/`: Contains the chat API route.
- `components/`: Includes reusable components used throughout the application.
  - `ui/`: Contains UI-specific components.
- `config/`: Stores configuration files.
- `lib/`: Holds utility functions and libraries.
- `public/`: Contains static assets such as images and favicon.
- `styles/`: Includes global and component-specific CSS styles.
- `types/`: Defines TypeScript types used in the application.

## Pages and Components

### App Directory
The `app/` directory contains the main application pages and layouts. Here are the key files:

- `layout.tsx`: Defines the overall layout of the application, including the main navigation and site header.
- `page.tsx`: Represents the home page of the application, where users can input their discussion prompts and generate AI responses.

### Components
The `components/` directory contains reusable components used throughout the application. Some notable components include:

- `discussion-response.tsx`: Displays the generated AI discussion response to the user.
- `main-nav.tsx`: Represents the main navigation of the application, allowing users to navigate between different pages.
- `site-header.tsx`: Renders the header section of the application, typically including the logo and site title.
- `theme-toggle.tsx`: Allows users to switch between light and dark themes.
- `ui/`: Contains UI-specific components such as buttons, inputs, labels, and textareas. These components are built using Radix UI primitives and can be easily customized and reused.

## API Routes

### Chat Route
The `app/api/chat/route.ts` file defines the API route for handling chat-related requests. It is responsible for processing incoming requests, generating AI-powered discussion responses, and sending the responses back to the client.

## Styling
The project uses Tailwind CSS for styling. The `styles/globals.css` file contains global styles and Tailwind CSS directives. It defines custom color classes, dark mode styles, and base styles for the application.
